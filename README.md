# dataModel.OpenChannelManagement


### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [CrossSection](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/CrossSection/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Cross-Section made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain. A CrossSection defines any point of the system where raw-water properties are monitored by a device and/or computed via simulation.

- [OpenChannel](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/OpenChannel/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Channel made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain.

- [OpenChannelFlowRegulation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/OpenChannelFlowRegulation/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic simulation of a series of independent regulation structures to establish specific flow conditions in the conveyance system. It is made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain.

- [RegulationStructureSimulation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/RegulationStructureSimulation/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a data model for regulation structure simulation, for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain.

- [Spillway](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/Spillway/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description for a generic Spillway made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain. Spillway represents a junction-type object, controlling the release of water from a dam or regulation structure downstream.
