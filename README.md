# dataModel.OpenChannelManagement


### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [CrossSection](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/CrossSection/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Cross-Section made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain. A CrossSection defines any point of the system where raw-water properties are monitored by a device and/or computed via simulation.

- [OpenChannel](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/OpenChannel/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Channel made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain.

- [OpenChannelCurve](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/OpenChannelCurve/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic curve made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain.

- [OpenChannelFlowRegulation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/OpenChannelFlowRegulation/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic simulation of a series of independent regulation structures to establish specific flow conditions in the conveyance system. It is made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain.

- [OpenChannelJunction](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/OpenChannelJunction/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Junction made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain. A Junction defines a location where the characteristics of the channel changes, two or more channels come together or split apart, amounts of water are abstracted or inserted to the system etc.

- [OpenChannelSystem](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/OpenChannelSystem/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic system made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain. This entity represents either a system composed of different components (e.g., channels, junctions, cross-sections etc.) or just a component (e.g., a SluiceGate).

- [RegulationStructure](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/RegulationStructure/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Regulation Structure made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain. Regulation structure represents a junction-type object, controlling the water flow in the raw-water system.

- [RegulationStructureSimulation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/RegulationStructureSimulation/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a data model for regulation structure simulation, for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain.

- [SluiceGate](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/SluiceGate/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Sluice Gate made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain.

- [Spillway](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/Spillway/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description for a generic Spillway made for Raw-Water (Open Channels) System Management domain. Spillway represents a junction-type object, controlling the release of water from a dam or regulation structure downstream.
